# Coffee Sales Dashboard

### Overview

This repository contains the `Coffee_Sales_Data.xlsx` file, which was used to create a dashboard for analyzing coffee sales. All data cleaning and analysis were performed entirely in Excel, using features like **XLOOKUP()** to consolidate data from multiple sheets into the `Orders` sheet for streamlined analysis.

### Dashboard Features

- **Sales by Country**: Breakdown of revenue from top countries (e.g., US, Ireland).
- **Top 5 Customers**: Highlight of the highest-spending customers.
- **Interactive Filters**:
  - Roast Types: Dark, Light, Medium.
  - Package Sizes: 0.2 kg to 2.5 kg.
  - Loyalty Card usage.
