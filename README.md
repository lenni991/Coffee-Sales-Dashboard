# Coffee Sales Dashboard

### Overview
This repository contains the `OrdersData.xlsx` file, used to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing coffee sales data. The analysis was performed entirely in Excel, with data cleaning, consolidation, and visualization. The objective was to create a dashboard, allowing for easy filtering and exploration.

The dataset contains approximately **1200 rows** per sheet (Orders, Customers, and Products).


## Summary:

- Developed an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing $45,134 in coffee sales across 3 countries, leveraging advanced Excel functions to clean and consolidate 1,000+ records from multiple sheets with 14 data points per transaction.
- Created dynamic visualizations revealing 13% year-over-year growth (2019-2021), with United States generating 79% ($35,639) of total revenue and large packages (2.5kg) accounting for 53% ($23,786) of sales.
- Implemented 4 interactive filters enabling granular analysis across time periods, product attributes (4 coffee types, 3 roast types), and customer segments, identifying that March and June sales were 105% higher than lowest-performing month (August).
